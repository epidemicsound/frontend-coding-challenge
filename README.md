## Overview

Welcome! This repository is the starting point for your frontend interview at Epidemic Sound today.

Today, you'll work to build a small UI component with some expected behavior and requirements using HTML, JavaScript/TypeScript, and CSS. You may use any Web framework/library you like, but we encourage you to use React, our preferred frontend library here
at Epidemic Sound.

This live-coding exercise will be conducted in GitHub Codespaces, which are cloud-based development environments integrated with Microsoft VSCode. If you're used to using VSCode, or really any IDE, you'll feel right at home! You can learn more about Codespaces [by clicking here](https://github.com/features/codespaces).

## Set-up Instructions

You've already completed the very first stepâ€”finding this repository! Before we get started, please follow the instructions below to set-up your live-coding environment.

1. Please log-in to your GitHub account, if you haven't already.
2. Click the "Open in GitHub Codespaces" button at the bottom of this page to open this repository in a Codespace.
   1. Follow instructions to create the Codespace instance. You will be brought to a setup window with some settings. Keep the default settings and then click "Create codespace" to start it up.
   2. Wait a bit for the application to initialize. A browser window running the application (with hot-reloading!) should open by default, as well as files where you will implement your solution. These files are called `src/SolutionJSX.jsx` and `src/SolutionTSX.tsx`, please feel free to choose either depending on if you want to use JavaScript and JSX or TypeScript and TSX.
3. Share your screen in the meeting room (if in-person) or in the Google Meet (if remote) so that the interviewer can follow along as you work.
4. You're ready to go! Your interviewer will give you today's coding challenge prompt now. Best of luck!
